A game where smileys (emojis) are on the move.  :)

"The Smiley Game"
Launched: May 2022
Created by: Katja Pesonen


The Smiley Game is a simple yet fun video game that can be played by people of all ages. 

For best performance use a computer with a Chrome browser and have the window on full-screen mode. The left and right arrows on a keyboard are required to play the game, so it is not supported for mobile phone use. Please use a computer and preferably Chrome as your browser. 

The idea behind the project was to create a simple game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was to be fun, above all else, so the functionality was the main priority to create a successful game. Time constraints mean the game is simple. Further technical improvements could be made to the game in future.

The game was first launched in May 2022 via GitHub, and relaunched in December 2022. It is currently not open for outside contributions from other developers.
